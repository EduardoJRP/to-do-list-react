# To-Do List App

## Description

In this project I worked with React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
I developed a ToDo List for any usage need it for a human, for example setting if they need to do any chores or
activities in general.

This works by filling out the input with the type of task you need to do, e.g. "washing dishes". And then adding it to the list.
Then you can eliminated if probably you typed it incorrectly, or you can select that it is done too.
